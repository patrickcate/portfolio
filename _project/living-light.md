Poster advertising the "Living Light" exhibition at the _Museum of Ordinary Things_ in New York City. The exhibit showcases artists from around the world as they created art which melded luminous objects with organic forms and shapes. The museum focuses on artwork which incorporates everyday objects to create visually interesting and thought-provoking works of art.
