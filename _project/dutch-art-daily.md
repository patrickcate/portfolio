Design for the <a href="http://www.dutchartdaily.com" target="_blank">DutchArtDaily.com</a> website. The art discovery site caters to fans of Dutch paintings from the Dutch Golden Age period of the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Every day a new Dutch Golden Age painting is featured with specific information about the artwork. In addition to the overall site design, a custom logotype was created. Multiple variations of the logo were made to make it flexible for different mediums and screen sizes.
